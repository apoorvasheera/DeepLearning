## Overview of Assignment

Writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

* Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
* Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
* Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
* Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
* Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation.
* Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks.
